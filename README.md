We are preparing to capture the full opportunity of our [approved observing proposal](https://github.com/davidthomas5412/StarTrailProposal_NOAO2019a/blob/master/dthomas50094253655.pdf). We envision this repository as (1) a record of our progress, (2) a repository to store notes and results, (3) a communication channel, and (4) a starting point for those looking to get involved.
